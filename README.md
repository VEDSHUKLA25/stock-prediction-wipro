Wipro Stock Price Movement Prediction (Aug 2024 – Aug 2025)

This project predicts whether Wipro stock (NSE: WIPRO) will go Up (1) or Down (0) the next day using Machine Learning in Python.

The project uses historical stock data from 14 Aug 2024 to 14 Aug 2025 and applies a Random Forest Classifier.

🚀 Features

✅ Fetches stock data automatically using yfinance

✅ Creates moving averages (MA20, MA50) and daily returns as features

✅ Predicts next-day stock movement (Up/Down)

✅ Visualizes stock prices, returns, and predictions

✅ Evaluates model performance with Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix

📊 Results

Model Accuracy: 71% 🎯

Below is an example confusion matrix of predictions:
